## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I will use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I then tried out my model on images of German traffic signs that my found on the web.

One could find the implementation in Ipython notebook file (Traffic_Sign_Claasifier_P2.ipynb).

A detailed writeup(writeup.md) of the project is provided.

A html file(report.html) is the exported version of this project after a run.



### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset and Repository

1. Download the data set.  There are pickled datasets in which the images are already resized to 32x32 and contains training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook, the writeup, report and a couple of example images.
3. The signnames.csv file contains the table of the sign and its class label.
4. The from web downloaded images are contained the the folder named "web_images_resiezd".
